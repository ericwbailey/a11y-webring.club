# Code of conduct

I ([Eric Bailey](https://ericwbailey.website/)) believe that people who want to contribute to this webring project should be able to. This means creating a safe, inclusive environment.

## Criteria

If you choose to participate in this webring, you agree to not discriminate based on the following criteria:

* Age,
* Body size,
* Permanent disability and temporary impairments,
* Ethnicity,
* Gender identity and expression,
* Level of experience and education,
* Nationality,
* Physical appearance,
* Race,
* Religion,
* Sex characteristics,
* Sexual identity, and
* Socioeconomic status

Discrimination is not limited to the preceding list. The list serves as an example of the kinds of criteria we take into consideration when considering what constitutes discrimination.

### Overlays, closed platforms, and inaccessible sites

Overlay companies and overlay company employees are specifically not allowed to participate.

Sites with egregious accessibility issues will be asked to address their content before being considered.

Sites that own your content such as Medium or Facebook cannot be used as a website for the webring.

## Reporting

If you have experienced behavior that violates the code of conduct, please make me aware of it. Reports will be investigated immediately to determine next steps.

When describing an incident, please include as much pertinent information as you feel comfortable sharing. While I understand that revisiting this information can be unpleasant, doing so will help provide a better context for the report and a more informed response.

If you feel you have been unfairly accused of violating these guidelines, please follow the same reporting process. I also ask you to report if you observe a violation of the code of conduct happening to someone else.

All information shared with me will be handled in the strictest confidence.

## Enforcement and consequences

I am responsible for ensuring that violators of our code of conduct will be held accountable.

Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. This includes temporarily or permanently ceasing current and future contributions to this webring, regardless of the size or scale of their impact.

The scope of consequence, and communication of enforcement is determined by me. I also have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject content and contributions that do not align with the behavior the code of conduct outlines.

Any participants who attempt to abuse the reporting process will be considered to be in violation of the code of conduct with regards to consequences. False reporting, especially with an intention to retaliate or exclude, will not be tolerated.

## Scope

This code of conduct applies to:

* The [a11y-webring.club](https://a11y-webring.club/) website
* Websites listed in the webring
* Supporting resources and services (ex: [GitHub](https://github.com/ericwbailey/a11y-webring.club))
